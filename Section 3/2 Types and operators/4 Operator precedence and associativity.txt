Operator precedence: (priority)
=====================

	which operator function gets called first where there are more than one.

	Functions are called in order of precedence(HIGHER precedence wins).


Associativity: ( order )
=============
	
	Come into play 2 or more operator have the same precedence.

	* Left to right
	* Right to left
	
	what order a operator gets called in.

	var a = 2, b = 3, c = 4;
	a=b=c;
	a=4
	console.log(a)
	console.log(b)
	console.log(c)
