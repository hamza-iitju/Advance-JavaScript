Function constructors:
======================

	Right way to create objects in JS.

	'new' is an operator.

	when we use 'new', immediately an empty object is created and then it invokes the function.

	Here it changes where this variable points to.

	'this' points to the empty object.

	As long as function doesn't returns that object that was created by the new variable.

	Function constructors are just functions.

	Function constructors are just normal functions used to construct objects.
	==========================================================================

	The 'this' keyword points to a new empty object, and that object is returned from the function automatically.
