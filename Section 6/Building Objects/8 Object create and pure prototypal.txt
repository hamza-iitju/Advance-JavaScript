Object.create and pure prototypal:
==================================

	JS also uses pure prototypal inheritance.

	Object.create()

	Building the same things differently.


	If we make a object using Object.create().

	override properties and methods on those object.

	Base object properties and methods side inside prototype of the derived object.


	Polyfill:
	=========

		Code that adds a feature that the JS engine may lack.

		Adding new feature that older JS engine may not have.

	Object.create():
	================

	create a object and use this object as prototype for other object.
