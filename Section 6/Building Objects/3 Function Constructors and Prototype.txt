Function Constructors and Prototype:
==================================

How to set Prototype for us?

	When we use a Function constructor, it already sets the Prototype for us.

	Functions is a special type of object.

	Name
	Code

	* All functions have prototype property.

	* Starts as an empty object.

	* As soon as  a new operator is , then it is called.

	* Available inside the function constructor.

	* __proto__ to get access to the prototype

	* prototype property of the function is NOT the prototype of the function.

	* To create a new prototype for every object created using 'new', we use class_name.prototype.method

	* This is shared among all objects.

	* Instead of creating methods inside the function, which is created everytime a new object is created using 'new' operator.. we set those methods in the prototype so that other object created using 'new' can share the same method without creating it again.

	* saves memory space
