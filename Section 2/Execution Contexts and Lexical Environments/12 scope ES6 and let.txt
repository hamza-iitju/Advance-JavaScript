Scope, ES6 and let
=================

Scope is where a variable is availabe in your code.

and if it's truly the same variable or a new copy.

ECMAScript 6:
=============

	New way of declaring variables using 'let'

	'let' allow JS engine to use block scoping.

	if(a > b){
		let c = true;
	}

	Not allowed to use it until the line of  code is run during execution phase that acutally declares the variable.

	Declared inside a block.
