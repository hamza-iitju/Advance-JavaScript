Creation and Hosting:
---------------------

	var a = 'hello world';
	function b(){
		console.log(a);
	}
	b();
	console.log(a);

	Execution context is created in two phases

		Creation Phase:
		===============

			Global Object
			this
			Outer env

			Recognizes where you have created variables and functions

			Setups memory space for variables and functions 'Hosting'

			Before code begins executed, JS engine sets up memory for variables and functions.

			When code begins to execute, it can be accessed.

		Execution Phase:
		================

				b();
				console.log(a); // Parser says I DON'T KNOW ITS VALUE!! SETTING IT TO UNDEFINED.
				var a = 'Hello World!';
				function b() {
				    console.log('called b');
				}





		JS engine doesn't know it value so it defaults to 'undefined'

		All JS variables are initially set to 'undefined'
