		function b(){
			var myVar;
		}
		function a(){
			var myVar = 2;
			b();
		}
		var myVar = 1;
		a();

		Global exection context is created and code executed myVar = 1
		a() is invoked during it execution context
		myVar is set to 2
		b() is invoked
		myVar is set to undefined.

		Scopes:
		=======
			Each of the myVar has its own execution context.
