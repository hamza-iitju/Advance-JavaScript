Call, apply, bind:
=================

	Variable env
	this
	outer env

	All functions have access to

		call() - // let you control what this means.
		apply() // takes this and an array of parameters.
		bind() - creates a copy of the function you are calling it on and what ever methods you pass it on.


	Function currying:
	==================

		creating a copy of function but with some present parameters.
		very useful in mathematical situations.
