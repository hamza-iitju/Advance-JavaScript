Objects and Functions:
=====================

They are almost same in JS

Objects:
========

	A collection of name/value pairs which can contain other name/value pairs

How Object resides in computer Memory:
========================================

	Primitive(Property)
 	Object(Property)
 	Functions(Methods)

 	Sit in Memory.
 	Have references to address of the Property and methods in the JS.

 	Computer Member access operator (. => Left to right associativity)
 	===============================

 	var person = new Object();

	person["firstname"] = "Tony"; // object gets a reference to the address of the location in memory.
	person["lastname"] = "Alicea";

	var firstNameProperty = "firstname";

	console.log(person); // Object
	console.log(person[firstNameProperty]); // Tony

	console.log(person.firstname); // Tony
	console.log(person.lastname); // Alicea

	person.address = new Object();

	person.address.street = "111 Main St.";
	person.address.city = "New York";
	person.address.state = "NY";

	console.log(person.address.street);
	console.log(person.address.city);
	console.log(person["address"]["state"]);

	Always use dot opertor for member access.
