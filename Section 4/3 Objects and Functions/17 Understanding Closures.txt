=======================

Closures:
=========

	Under the hood:

	Function is hoisted in global execution context
	Invokes greet and new execution context is created
	whattosay get params from function
	greet execution context is poped off after its execution
	But whattosay has hi in memory still.

	execution context is closed in its outer variables.
	sayHi('Tony') has access to whattosay hi value.
