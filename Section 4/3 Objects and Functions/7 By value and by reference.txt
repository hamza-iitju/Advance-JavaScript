By value and by reference:
==========================

	a has an address value of its primitive type.
	b=a (points to new address and a copy is made with same value)

By Value:
========

	By copying the value, into 2 separate spots in memory

By reference:
=============

	a points to a object

	if we do b = a, then we do b is reference the object.

	All objects interact by reference.


	Mutate = to change something.

	immutable means it can't be changed.

	All primitives are by value.

	All functions and objects are by reference.
