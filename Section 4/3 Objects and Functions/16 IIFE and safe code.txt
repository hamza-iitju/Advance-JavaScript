IIFE and safe code:
==================

var firstname = 'JOhn';
(function(name){
	var greeting = 'Hello';
	console.log(greeting + ' ' + name);
}(firstname));

Execution stack:
===============

	code loaded and has global execution context.
	Hits IIFE
	When hits functions, does creation phase
	sees those paraenthesis, new execution context is created.
