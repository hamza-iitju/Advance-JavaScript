Strict Mode:
============

	Tell the JS engine to process the code in a stricter way.

	Implement some extra rules when parsing my code.

	Useful for strict code is that.

	Declare a variable before using it.

	Goes inside either top of the file or top of the function.

	If we have lots of JS files and Minify and combine them

	If the first file has 'use strict' then the whole JS file complies to strict mode of execution.
