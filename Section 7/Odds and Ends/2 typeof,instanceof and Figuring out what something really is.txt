typeof,instanceof and Figuring out what something really is:
=============================================================

	Dynamic typing in JS work

	What if we want to know the type of a variable.

	We use typeof, instanceof

	call() - invoke this function but tell what 'this' should point to.

	

	type of number is number
	type of string is string
	type of object is object.
	type of array is object.
	Object.prototype.toString.call() - this returns type as array.
	type of object created using 'new' keyword is an object.
	type of function statement is an object.
	type of Function expression is a function.
	type of undefined is undefined.

	instance of new object is the parent object.
